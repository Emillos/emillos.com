# Intro
This repo is just for me to try out tech.
I'm generally testing out services provided by AWS.

This is a new project and a work in progress, so pretty barebones at the moment, but the idea is to create small projects and then incorporate AWS into them - listing the tech used in the footer.

Currently using Github actions, will be moved to a aws code pipeline at some point and set up in the CDK
